Microcontroller
Arduino Uno (any will work)

Motor Controller 
3X L298HN - these can be gotten for free as samples from ST
2.5" x 3.125" Perf Board
Terminal Strips
22AWG Solid core wire
3X Aluminum heatsinks (I cut in half an old northbridge heatsink)
Thermal paste
Power
9V Battery (to power the Arduino)
Approximately 12V LiPo or Li-ion battery (I modified a laptop battery, so I did not even need to buy a charger)
5V regulator (To regulate power to the motor controller logic circutry)
9V Battery clip
Barrel connector (Must fit the Arduino power connector)
Other Electronics
4X 7 RPM Gear Motor (These power two legs each)
4X Thin linear trim pots (Rotation sensors for the legs)
DPDT Toggle switch (Power switch)
SPDT Slide switch (User input)
2X Mini Snap Action Switch (Limit switch)
3 10K resistors (Pull down)
Headers
Signal Wire (Old IDE cables work really well, and let you organize your wires easily)
Heat Shrink Tubing
Hardware
12'  3/4" x 1/8" Aluminum Bar (These come in 6' lengths at my local hardware store)
6" x 3" acrylic sheet (Electronics are mounted to this)
6x Standoffs with screws
1' Threaded rod and corresponding 1/2" nut
2X 1' x 3/16" steel rod
1' x 3/16" I.D. Brass Tubing
4X 5mm Aluminum Universal Mounting Hub
Pack of large T Pins
4X 3/32 screws (to mount the motors)
An assortment of 4/40 screws and nuts
Assorted hex screws and nuts
4X Bic pens (I used the plastic shafts to fix the pots on the legs in place)
4X Locknuts
5 Minute epoxy
Sheet metal scraps (For spacing and mounting things. Bits of Meccano work well)
Stick on Velcro (For holding on the batteries)
Hard Drive reading head bearing
3/4" Plastic angle
Electrical Tape
Zip Ties
